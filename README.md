# Philosophy
[Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/), the creator of C++, designed the language with a philosophy centered on providing **flexibility** without sacrificing **efficiency or performance**.

- **General-purpose**: C++ should be usable for low-level system programming, as well as for high-level abstractions.
- **Multi-paradigm**: Support for procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.
- **Control over Resources**: Features like constructors, destructors, and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) provide systematic and safe resource management.
- **Extensibility and Compatibility**: Designed to extend C without breaking compatibility, allowing programs to grow from C to C++ smoothly.
- **Type Safety with Flexibility**: Strong static typing that supports user-defined types while allowing low-level access when needed.

## Some applications

- **Adobe Systems**: Most applications are developed in C++:
    - Photoshop & ImageReady,
    - Illustrator,
    - Acrobat,
    - InDesign,
    - GoLive,
    - Frame (mostly C, some C++) 

- **Apple** Finder

- **Dassault Systems**: Catia v5 (CAD) on which was notably conceived all recent Airbus planes.

- **Microsoft**: Literally everything at Microsoft is built using recent flavors of Visual C++ (using older versions would automatically cause an application to fail the security review). The list would include major products like:
    - Windows XP, Vista, System 7
    - Windows NT (NT4 and 2000)
    - Windows 9x (95, 98, Me)
    - Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Outlook)
    - Internet Explorer (including Outlook Express)
     - Visual Studio (Visual C++, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro) (Some parts of Visual Studio like the Base Class Libraries that ship with the .NET Framework were written using C# but the C# compiler itself is written in C++.)
     - Exchange
    - SQL 
    
- **KDE** (K Desktop Environment): powerful open source graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations. It consists of about 300 different packages written in C++, including an office suite, a browser, development tools, games, and multimedia apps.

# Hello World !

Your C++ journey begins with a *simple* but **powerful** program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
    std::cout << "Hello World !" << std::endl;

    return (0);
}
```

Let's break this program down to introduce some core-concepts:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

- `#` indicates a **preprocessor** statement. Before your code is compiled, the preprocessor *processes* all these statements.

- Similarly to C, you need to `include` **libraries** to be able to use them.

- `iostream` is the **standard input/output** [stream](#stream) library. Which here, allows you to use `std::cout` and `std::endl`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
>- [Preprocessor](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor.html) (cppreference.com)
>- [*How to use librairies in C++*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10358745/how-to-use-libraries) (stackoverflow.com)
>- [`iostream`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/iostream.html) (cppreference.com)


```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World !" << std::endl;
```

- `std` stands for **standard [namespace](#namespace)**, which groups together **names** ([classes](#classes), functions, [objects](#objects) ...) defined by the C++ standard library.

- `::` is the **scope resolution operator**. It is used to **access a name** that belongs to a specific [**scope**](#scope).

- `cout` stands for ***console out***, which is a global [**object**](#objects) representing the **standard output stream**.

- `<<` is the **stream insetion operator**. **In this case**, it is used to sends the value on its right into the [stream](#stream) on its left. Multiple `<<` can be chained to send several *concatenated* pieces of data.

- `endl` stands for ***end line***, which is a **manipulator** that inserts the newline character (`\n`) and then flushes the output buffer.

# Classes
## Concept
A `class` in C++ is a user-defined type that acts as a blueprint for creating [objects](#objects), grouping together related data ([attributes and functions (methods)](#members-attributes--methods)) into one single unit.

A `class` defines how objects of that type are **structured** and **behave**.

Classes allow you to model **complex entities** (like cars, accounts, or shapes) by encapsulating their attributes and behaviors in one place.

```cpp
// Rectangle.hpp
class Rectangle
{
    public:
        int width;
        int height;
};
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Classes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/classes.html) (cppreference.com)

## Construct and destruct an instance

To create an **instance** of a given `class`, you will have to define a **[public](#access-specifiers)** ***constructor*** and a ***destructor*** in order to respectively *construct* and *destruct* a class **instance** outside its own scope.

### Constructor 

A **constructor** is a special [member function](#members-attributes--methods) executed when an object is declared, initializing the object‚Äôs **state**, [members and base class](#inheritence) : calling their respective constructors.

- C++ allows a class to have **multiple constructors**, each with different parameter lists (**overloading**).

- A constructor without any parameter become the **default constructor**. It will be automatically called at the instance declaration.

- If **no constructors are declared**, the compiler automatically generates a default constructor which is qualified as ***trivial*** : it **only** performs member and base class ***default initializations***.

- If any constructor is declared, but **none is a default constructor**, the compiler **does not** generate one.

```cpp
className(/* optionnal parameters */);
```

### Destructor

The **destructor** is run when an object‚Äôs lifetime ends (when it goes out of scope or after a `delete` call), releasing resources.

- **Only one destructor** is permitted per class.

- Overloading destructors is not allowed (can never take arguments or return a value).

- Can be virtual (should be for [polymorphic](#polymorphism) base classes)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`virtual` functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/virtual-function-cpp/) (geeksforgeeks.org)

```cpp
~className(); // No overloading
```

### Example

```cpp
// Rectangle.hpp
class Rectangle
{
    public:
        Rectangle();                        // default
        Rectangle(int width, int height);   // overloaded
        ~Rectangle();                       // default
   // ...  
};
```

>- [Access Specifiers](#access-specifiers)
>- [Orthodox Canonical class form](#members-attributes--methods)

## Classes vs Structs

Both classes and structs are user-defined types that can contain attributes and functions.
Meanwhile, classes allows you to set up **access specifiers** (private by default) to build **complex** data-types, in an [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)-way with desidered **accessibility and behavioral restrictions**.

### POD
Sometimes you will not need a `class`. Programming in C++ does not mean putting some classes everywhere.
***POD*** stands for **Plain Old Data**, it describes types that have **simple**, **C-compatible** memory layout and behavior.

A type is *POD* if it satisfies two requirements:
- [Trivial](#constructor) (simple construction/destruction)
- Standard layout (C-compatible memory layout)

To check if the `class` you created is POD (and then should -*in most cases*- be a struct), you can use the [UnaryTypeTrait](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/UnaryTypeTrait.html) ([class template](https://www.en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template.html)) `std::is_pod<T>` (‚ö†Ô∏è C++11) as follows:

```cpp
std::cout << std::is_pod<Class>::value << std::endl; 
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See 
>- [Passive data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure) (wikipedia.org) and [Plain Old Object (C++)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_C%2B%2B_Object) (wikipedia.org)

#### Choose the adequate datatype

|   Use Case                            |  Prefer `struct` |   Prefer `class`  |

# Objects

An object is an entity.

> *C++ programs create, destroy, refer to, access and manipulate objects.* 
>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Object](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object.html) (cppreference.com)


## Objects can be sorted in differents categories...
- Fundamental type objects
```cpp
int x = 42;
```

- Pointer objects :
```cpp
int *ptr;
```

- Array objects :
```cpp
int array[42];
```

- Class-type objects
```cpp
std::string str;
```

## ...and they have differents key characteristics.

- **Type**: Each determined at compile-time (C++ is a statically typed language).
```cpp
typeid(variable).name()
```

- **Storage**: Objects occupy memory with specific size.
```cpp
sizeof(variable)
```

- **Lifetime**: Objects have well-defined creation and destruction points.
    - **Memory allocation**: The compiler reserves memory for the object. For **stack** objects, memory is allocated when execution enters the block while for **heap** objects (via `new`), memory is allocated in the available memory space. 
    - **Constructor execution**: Class-type objects invoke a [constructor](#construct-and-destruct-an-instance) that initializes **member** variables and *may acquire resources*.
        Constructors can be **default** (no parameters), **parameterized**, or **copy** constructors (cf. [Orthodox Canonical class form](#orthodox-canonial-form)).
        During this phase, ***base class*** (!= derived) constructors run first (for inheritance), then member objects' constructors, and finally the enclosing class's constructor itself.
    
    - **Lifetime begins**: Once construction is complete, the object becomes *usable*. 

    - **Destructor execution**: When the object's lifetime ends (either automatic [scope](#scope) exit or `delete` for dynamic objects), its [destructor](#construct-and-destruct-an-instance) runs. The **destructor** is responsible for releasing resources.
        For class hierarchies, destructors run in reverse: the enclosing class destructor first, then member objects' destructors, and finally base class destructors.
    
    - **Memory deallocation**: Memory is released back to the system, either automatically for stack objects or manually for heap objects with delete.

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
    >- [Memory allocation, pointers & references](#memory-allocation-pointers--references)
    >- [Classes](#classes)
    >- [Inheritence](#inheritence)

- **Identity**: Each object has a unique address in memory (except for [bit-fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field) and [register variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(keyword))).

    An object is addressable if:

    - **Occupies Memory**: Has a location in the program's address space

    - **Byte-Aligned**: Can be referenced by a byte address (eg. bit-field)
    
    - **Observable**: Not completely optimized away by the compiler

- **State**: Objects maintain internal data that can change over time (eg. register variables).
    
    An object's state is the **complete set of values held by all its member variables** (data members), at anytime during runtime.
    The state represents the object's "*configuration*" that distinguishes one instance from another of the same type.

    > üí° [Static members](#static--const-keywords) belong to the class as a whole, not an individual object's state.

    ```cpp
    // Rectangle.hpp
    class Rectangle
    {
        int width;
        int height;
    };
    ```

    ```cpp
    // main.cpp
    Rectangle rect;

    rect.width = 4;
    rect.height = 2;
    ```
    The **state** of `rect` (instance from the `Rectangle` class) is, at a given instant during runtime: `{width = 4; height = 2;}`.

- **Value**: An object's value generally refers to the *abstract* interpretation of the **object's state as a single meaningful entity** used in computations or comparisons.

    ```cpp
    rect.width = 4;
    ```

> üí° **Distinction**
>
>```cpp
>// main.cpp
>Rectangle r1 = {4, 2};
>Rectangle r2 = {4, 3};
>```
>- **Identity**: `&r1 != &r2` (different memory locations)
>- **State**: `r1 = {width = 4, height = 2}` and `r2 = {width = 4, height = 3}` (different states)
>- **Value**: `r1.width == r2.width` (both have a height of 4)

## Quiz
- Is a class itself an object ? [Y/N] (N)

***

# Members: attributes & methods

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the object-oriented principle of bundling **data** ([state](#objects)) and **behavior** ([methods](#methods)) into a class and **restricting direct access** to some of the object‚Äôs components. This enforces **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **robustness**.

- **Information hiding**: Prevent external code from depending on internal representations.
- **Maintain invariants**: Control how **state changes** so the object remains in a valid condition.
- **Improve compilation efficiency**: **Minimize dependencies** between modules.
- **Increase robustness**: Prevent **misuse** of an object‚Äôs **internal data**.

## Attributes

Attributes are variables (often called *data members*) that belong to the class and **define the properties** of the objects instanciated from this class.
A good practice is to have a maximum amount of `private` or `protected` data.

```cpp
int height;  
```

## Methods

Methods are functions (often called *member functions*) that belong to a determined class. They are used to **manipulate the class's data** members.
We often use simple mono use function to *get* or *set* private attributes, we call them respectively **getters** and **setters**.

```cpp
int getHeight(void);  
```

## Access specifiers

In C++, you can restrict the visibility and the accessibility to determined class members. C++ provides three access specifiers :

- **`public`** : accessible from **anywhere** in the code. May be useful notably for **public constants**, **constructors and destructors**.
- **`protected`** : accessible within [base and derived](#inheritence) classes. Useful to build *in-class sub-restrictions*.
- **`private`** : only accessible within the class. Core-concept of [encapsulation](#encapsulation).

> üí° **Good practices tips**
>- A well-designed class keep private a maximum amount of data, while having some ***[getters/setters](#methods)*** to respectively read or modify them.
>- When building a `class`, start setting all members as `private`, then you will set as `public` only the needed members.

|   Keyword         |   *Within* the class  |   From *derived* classes  |   From *outside*  the class    |
|   --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |   ---------------------------- |
|   **`public`**    |   yes                 |   yes                     |   yes                          |
|   **`protected`** |   yes                 |   yes                     |   no                           |
|   **`private`**   |   yes                 |   no                      |   no                           |

> üí° By default, each member declared inside a `class` is **private**.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Inheritence](#inheritence)

## Some other keywords

### `static`

Static data members are not associated with the objects of the class: they are **independent** variables/functions with **static storage duration**. They still belong to the `class`.

They are useful for maintaining a shared data among all instances of the class.

**Static attributes**
- **Only one copy** of that member is created for all instances of a given `class`.
- They have to be **defined once**, given the **ODR (One Definition Rule)** and the fact that **definition** occurs while instanciating a `class` into an object : you have to define them **outside the class**, and **outside any function**. 
- Its lifetime is the **entire program** but its **visibility** is limited to the actual **translation unit**.
- They cannot be associated with `mutable` keyword.

```cpp
// staticAttribute.hpp
class Entity
{
    public:
        static int count;                       // declaration
        Entity(void) { ++this->count; };
};

```

```cpp
// main.cpp
int Entity::count;                              // definition

int	main(void)
{
    Entity e1;
    Entity e2;
	
    std::cout << Entity::count << std::endl;    // outputs 2

    return (0);
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
>- [Static Data Members](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-static-data-members/) (geeksforgeeks.org)
>- [ODR (One Definition Rule)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition.html) (cppreference.com)
>- [*Why does a static data member need to be defined outside of the class ?*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18749071/why-does-a-static-data-member-need-to-be-defined-outside-of-the-class) (stackoverflow.com)

**Static methods** 
- It's basically a normal function that's nested inside of the scope of the class. 
- Can be called **without creating an object**.
- Only has access to **static members (attributes or methods)**.
- Cannot use `this` to refer to a member because they don't belong to any instance of the `class`.
- Useful when a function‚Äôs logic is **independent** of object state.
- They cannot be associated with `virtual`, `const` or `volatile`.

```cpp
// staticMethods.hpp
class Entity
{
    public:
    	static int getValue(void) { return (_value); }; // declaration

    private:
    	static int _value;
};

```

```cpp
// main.cpp
int Entity::_value = 42;                            // definition & initialization

int	main(void)
{                                                   // no need to intanciate an object
    std::cout << Entity::getValue() << std::endl;   // outputs 42
    
    return (0);
}
```

>- [Storage class specifiers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration.html) (cppreference.com)


### `const`

**Constant objects**
- Object's **state** cannot be modified.
- Cannot **call non-`const` member functions**.
- `const` has to *close* the prototype, else that is the return datatype that is qualified as const.

**Constant methods**
- Can be called on **any type of object**.
- Cannot **change value** of their own class members.

> üí° **Good to know**
>
> The const property of an object goes into effect **after the constructor** finishes executing and ends **before the class's destructor** executes. So the constructor and destructor can modify the data members of the object, but other methods of the class can't.


```cpp
// constObjects.hpp
class Entity
{
    public:
        Entity(int id, std::string name)        // overloaded constructor
        {
            this->_id = id;
            this->_name = name;
        }
        void        displayEntity(void) const   // const qualifier at the end of the prototype
        {
            std::cout << this->_id << ": " << this->_name << std::endl;
        };

    private:
        int         _id;
        std::string _name;
};

```

```cpp
// main.cpp
int main(void)
{
    const Entity e1(42, "John");    // overloaded construction of a constant object

    e1.displayEntity();

    return (0);
}
```

# Scope


## Prequisites

Before starting digging into C++ scopes, we have to understand these three critical properties and their relationships :

- **Scope** is a fundamental compile-time concept that defines the *region of the program* where an identifier name can be used to **refer to its entity**.
    > *Where can I use this name ?* 
    >
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Scope](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/scope.html) (cppreference.com)

- **Lifetime** (or *storage duration*), determines when an object exists in memory : the time spent between memory allocation and deallocation. The concept of **lifetime** differs from the **scope**: a variable may go out of scope while its memory persists.
    > *When does this name exists ?* 
    >
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
    >- [Objects](#objects)
    >- [Memory allocation, pointers and references](#memory-allocation-pointers--references)

- **Visibility** concerns whether an identifier can actually be accessed within a particular scope, during its lifetime, which may be **restricted** by **[access specifiers](#access-specifiers)**, **name hiding** or **linkage**.
    > *Can I actually access this ?*

## Fundamental Scopes

C++ defines **fundamental scope categories**, each with distinct rules governing the identifier **[visibility](#prequisites)** and **behavior**.

### Global Scope (Namespace Scope/File Scope)

**Global scope** (or **namespace scope** in C++, **file scope** in C), encompasses declarations made outside any function, class or explicit [namespace](#namespaces).

An identifier declared at **global scope** is **visible** from is declaration to the end of the **translation unit** (source file and all included headers after preprocessing).

There is exactly one instance of each global variable throughout program execution (unless declared with **internal linkage**).

Global identifiers have external linkage by default, making them visible across translation units. The static keyword gives them internal linkage, restricting visibility to the current translation unit:
```cpp
// linkage.cpp
int         external_var = 1; // external linkage (visible across files)
static int  internal_var = 2; // internal linkage (local to this file)
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
>- [Translation units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_%28programming%29) (wikipedia.org)
>- [Translation units and linkage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/program-and-linkage-cpp?view=msvc-170) (learn.microsoft.com) and [Language Linkage](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage.html) (wikipedia.org)
>- [C++ Linkage explained](https://cppscripts.com/cpp-linkage) (cppscripts.com)

```cpp
 // globalScope.cpp
 int g_value = 42;  // g_value's scope begins here

 void foo()
 {
     // g_value is visible here
 }

 void bar()
 {
     // g_value still visible here
 }
 // ...
 // g_value's scope ends at the end of the translation unit
 ```

In C++, *global identifiers* technically reside within the **implicit global namespace**. You can refer to ***global names*** using the **scope resolution operator `::`** whith no prefix `::name`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Scope resolution operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/scope-resolution-operator-in-c/) (geeksforgeeks.org)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Local variables can hide global names, here comes the **scope resolution operator** :
>
> ```cpp
> // globalScope.cpp
> int   value = 42;
> 
> int   main(void)
> {
>   int value = 21;
>   
>   std::cout << value << std::endl;    // displays 21 (local)
>   std::cout << ::value << std::endl;  // displays 42 (global)
>
>   return (0);
> }
> ```

### Local Scope (Block Scope)

**Local scope** or **Block Scope** encompasses any identifier declared within a compound statement delimited by curly braces `{}`, from the declaration.

A block is created by any pair of braces `{}`, including :
- function bodies
- loop bodies
- conditionnal statements
- standalone braces

Variables declared within a block have **automatic storage duration** by default : they are **created** when execution reaches their declaration and **destroyed** when the block exits.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot use a variable before its declaration point within the same block, even though the entire block constitutes its scope.

```cpp
// localScope.cpp
void    example(void)
{
    int x = 42;     // x's scope begins
    {               // standalone brackets
        int y = x;  // y's scope begins
    }               // y's scope ends
}                   // x's scope ends
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Controls structures (`if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`...) create their own scopes with specific rules.
>
> Example :
>- In a `for` loop if the *iterator* is declared into the statement, it is not accessible outside of the loop and cannot be redeclared in the loop body.
>   ```cpp
>   for (int i = 0; i < 42; ++i) // i's scope begins
>   {
>       // i cannot be redeclared
>       std::cout << i << std::endl;
>   } // i's scope ends
>   ```
>- In a `switch` statement, a **single scope** is created, encompassing all case labels and their statements.
>   ```cpp
>   switch (value)
>   {
>       int x;      // x's scope extends through entire switch
>       case (1):
>           x = 10; // assignment (not initialization)
>           break;
>       case (2):
>           break; // x is in scope but may be uninitialized
>   }
>   ```
>   Initialization within case statements requires careful consideration. You cannot initialize a variable in one case **if subsequent cases can access it without that initialization occurring**, as this would violate initialization safety.
>

### Function Parameters Scope

**Function parameters scope** is the **most limited** scope type, applying only to parameter names in function declaration.

> ```cpp
> // functionParametersScope.cpp
> void invalid(int x, int x);   // duplicate parameter name
> void valid(int x, int y);
> ```

### Namespace

**Namespaces** provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects. All entitity that are declared inside a namespace are automatically placed in a [namespace scope](#namespace-scope) which prevents them from being mistaken for **indentically-named entities** in other scopes.
Otherwise, entities that are declared outside a namespace belong to the [global scope (Namespace Scope/File Scope)](#global-scope-namespace-scope-file-scope).

- **Scope Management**: Namespaces define where an identifier is **visible**.
- **Modularity**: Code can be **grouped logically**.
- **Name Collision Avoidance**: Identical identifiers in different namespaces are **distinct**.

A **namespace** is defined as follows :

```cpp
namespace Foo 
{
    int value = 42;
    int func(void)
    {
        return (42);
    }
}
```

You can access namespace members from different ways:

- **Fully Qualified Members** : Access each member using the **complete namespace path**.

```cpp
Foo::value++;
Foo::func();
```

- **Using Declaration**: Introduce a **single member** into the current scope.
```cpp
using Foo::func;

Foo::value++;
func();
```

- **Using Directive**: Introduce **all members** into the current scope.

```cpp
using namespace Foo;

value++;
func();
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **`using namespace` is not safe at all**
>
> Especially at global scope, it introduces mutliple significant risks, particularly in large, complex or evolving codebases.
>- **Name collision** : importing an entire `namespace` (for example the often seen : `using namesace std;`) floods the current scopes with thousands of identifiers. It might leeds to name collision with your code or some external librairies.
>- **Readability loss** : qualifying names with their namespaces (`std::cout`) makes it immediately clear which data (datatype, function, variable...) is being referenced.

##### Example

```cpp
// namespaceScope.cpp
int value = 42;
int func(void) { return (4); }

namespace   Foo
{
    int value = 21;
    int func(void)
    {
        return (2);
    }
}

namespace   Bar
{
    int value = 84;
    int func(void)
    {
        return (8);
    }
}

namespace   Muf = Foo;

int	main(void)
{
    std::cout   << Foo::value << std::endl      // displays 21 (Foo's namespace scope) 
                << Foo::func() << std::endl;    // displays 2   (Foo's namespace scope)

    std::cout   << Bar::value << std::endl      // displays 84 (Bar's namespace scope)
                << Bar::func() << std::endl;    // displays 8 (Bar's namespace scope)

    std::cout   << Muf::value << std::endl      // displays 21 (Muf(= Foo)'s namespace scope)
                << Muf::func() << std::endl;    // displays 2 (Muf(= Foo)'s namespace scope)

    std::cout   << ::value   << std::endl       // displays 42 (global)
                << ::func() << std::endl;       // displays 4 (global)
}
```
#### Quiz

1. According to the previous example, what would be outputed by the following code ?

```cpp
// ...
std::cout   << value << std::endl
            << func() << std::endl;
// ...
```

# Init lists

In C++, you can initialize **member variables** before the constructor body executes. 

- **Order of Initialization**: Members are initialized in the order they are declared in the class, not the order they appear in the initializer list.

- **Efficiency**: Using an initializer list can be more efficient than assigning values within the constructor body, especially for complex types.

- **Const and Reference Members**: These must be initialized using an initializer list since they cannot be assigned after the object is created.

```cpp
myClass(int param1, double param2)
    : attr1(param1), attr2(param2)
{
    /* optional body */
};
```
## Exemple

```cpp
// initList.hpp
class Player
{
    public:
    	Player(int id, double level, std::string name)
    		: _id(id), _level(level), _name(name)       // overloaded constructor initialization list
        {
            std::cout << "Player subscribed !" << std::endl;
        };
       
    	void		displayPlayer(void)
    	{
    		std::cout   << this->_id << " | "
                            << this->_level << " | "
                            << this->_name << std::endl;
    	};
    
    private:
    	int	        _id;
    	double		_level;
    	std::string	_name;
};
```

# Stream

Streams embody major C++ concepts such as **object-oriented design**, **operator overloading**, and ***templating***.

> üí° **Acknowledgment**
>
> Here is why this part will be as **complete as possible**, it can be too much if you **only want to use streams**.
>
> This said, keep in mind that understanding **streams and their architecture** is a big step towards an **accurate understanding of the language**.


## Stream architecture & design philosophy

The stream system provides a **unified**, **type-safe** interface for **input/output operations** that **abstracts the underlying data sources and destinations** while - again - maintaining great performance and flexibility.

## Context & design Reasoning

The `iostream` library was designed to **replace C's stdio functions** in a more robust and type-safe way.

Unlike C's `printf`/`scanf` family, which relies on **format strings** and **variadic arguments**, C++ streams use **operator overloading** and **template specialization** to achieve compile-time **type safety** and runtime **efficiency**.
The design aims to separate **formatting logic** (ex: `%s`, `%d`... from `stdio`) from **transport mechanisms** (ex: `FILE`, `fd`..), allowing to work with **console I/O**, **file operations**, and **string manipulations** with a single logic.

>- [`iostream`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/iostream.html) (cppreference.com) or [`iostream`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/) (cplusplus.com)
>- [Template Specialization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/template-specialization-c/) (geeksforgeeks.org)

## Stream class hierarchy and inheritence model

The **stream class hierarchy** follows a carefully desgined [inheritence](#inheritence) pattern that demonstrates various inheritence problem resolution such as **virtual** inheritence, **diamond** inheritence or *simply* multiple inheritence.

### Prequisites

- üèóÔ∏è ***Templates***
- üèóÔ∏è ***Traits***
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [*Understanding C++ Traits and Making Them Efficient*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66818748/understanding-c-traits-and-making-them-efficient) (stackoverflow.com) and [Character Traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/char_traits.html) (cppreference.com)
- Inheritence

### Base classes

- `ios_base`: The foundational *non-template* class that contains, **formatting state**, **error flags** and [**static members**](#static--const-keywords).

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
    >- [`ios_base`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base.html) (cppreference.com)
    >- [Format Control Using the Stream's Format State](https://stdcxx.apache.org/doc/stdlibug/28-3.html) (stdcxx.apache.org)


- `basic_ios<CharT, Traits>`: **Template** class [derived](#inheritence) from `ios_base`.
It introduces the concept of **character traits**, enabling streams to work with different **character types** (`char`, `wchar_t` (*wide character*)) while maintaining type safety.

    > üí° **Wide characters**
    >
    > *Wide character equivalents* (`wcin`, `wcout`, `wcerr`, `wclog`) are provided for `wchar_t`-based operations. These objects are guaranteed to be constructed **before `main` function begins** and **destroyed after it ends**, **ensuring their availability throughout program execution**.

### Stream interfaces classes

- `basic_istream<CharT, Traits>`: [**Inherits virtually**](#inheritence) from `basic_ios` and provides **formatted input** operations. This class implements the **extraction operator (`>>`)** and various `get()` methods for character-level input.

    > üí° ***Virtual inheritance*** prevents **diamond inheritance problems** when `basic_iostream` inherits from both `basic_istream` and `basic_ostream`. 
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`basic_istream<CharT, Traits>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream.html) (cppreference.com)


- `basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>`: [**Inherits virtually**](#inheritence) from `basic_ios`  and provides **formatted output** operations. Implements the **insertion operator (`<<`)** and `put()`/`write()` methods for character and string output.

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream.html) (cppreference.com)


- `basic_iostream<CharT, Traits>`: Uses [**multiple inheritance**](#inheritence) to combine `basic_istream` and `basic_ostream`.

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`basic_iostream<CharT, Traits>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_iostream.html) (cppreference.com)


### Stream buffer architecture

- `basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>`: defines an interface between stream objects (like `cin`, `cout`, or file streams) and their underlying data sources or destinations, such as files, memory buffers, or network sockets.

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See :
    >- [`basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_streambuf.html) (cppreference.com)
    >- [`virtual` functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/virtual-function-cpp/) (geeksforgeeks.org)

## Standard stream objects and global state

There are 4 predefined stream objects in the `std`'s [namespace](#namespace).

- `cin`: `basic_istream<char>` connected to standard input

    > ```cpp
    > std::cout << "Hello World !" << std::endl;
    > ```
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`cout`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cout.html) (cppreference.com)

- `cout`: `basic_ostream<char>` connected to standard output

    > ```cpp
    > std::string input;
    >
    > std::cin >> input;
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See:
    >>- [`cin`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cin.html) (cppreference.com)
    >>- [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string.html) (cppreference.com)

- `cerr`: `basic_ostream<char>` connected to standard error (**unbuffered**)

    > ```cpp
    > std::cerr << "An error occured" << std::endl;
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`cerr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cerr.html) (cppreference.com)

- `clog`: `basic_ostream<char>` connected to standard error (**buffered**)

    > ```cpp
    > std::clog << "Constructor called" << std::endl;
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`clog`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/clog.html) (cppreference.com)

> üí° Note that for wide characters, `wcin`, `wcout`, `wcerr` and `wclog` also exist.

## Stream state management and error handling

### The `iostate` flags

The `ios_base` class maintains 4 **state flags** (called ***iostates***) that indicate **stream condition** across **I/O operations**:

- ***goodbit***: Normal state, **successful**.
- ***eofbit***: **End-of-file** reached during input operation.
- ***failbit***: **Non-fatal** error occurred (format error, conversion failure).
- ***badbit***: **Fatal** error occurred (hardware failure, corrupted stream).

> üí° **How streams can have multiple flags set ?**
>
> Given that flags are actually **bits within a single integer**, the stream can have any combination of them set at once.
> |   Flag      |   *Decimal* value     |   *Binary* value (simplified) |    *Binary* value (full)                  |
> | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |  ---------------------------------------- |

### Checking stream state

You can **check** these **state flags** with these following [methods](#members-attributes--methods):

- `good()`: Returns true only when *goodbit* is set (no error flags).

    ```cpp
    
    ```

- `eof()`: Returns true when *eofbit* is set.

    ```cpp
    
    ```
- `fail()`: Returns true when *failbit* or *badbit* is set.

    ```cpp
    
    ```

- `bad()`: Returns true when *badbit* is set.

    ```cpp
    
    ```

### Manipulating stream state

You also can **manipulate** these **state flags**:

- `clear()`: Resets all flags to *goodbit* or `clear(iostate)` to set a specific state flags.
    
    > ```cpp
    > std::string input;
    >
    > input.clear();                            // iostate reset to goodbit
    > // or
    > input.clear(ios::eofbit);                 // iostate reset to eofbit
    > // or
    > input.clear(ios::failbit | ios::badbit);
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`clear`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/clear.html) (cppreference.com)

- `setstate(iostate)`: Sets additional state flags without clearing others
    
    > ```cpp
    > std::string input;
    >
    > input.setstate(ios::eof);
    > // or
    > input.setstate(ios::good | ios::eof);
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`setstate`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/setstate.html) (cppreference.com)

- `rdstate()`: Returns current state as iostate bitmask

    > ```cpp
    > std::string input;
    >
    > input.clear();
    > input.clear();
    > ```
    >> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [`rdstate`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/rdstate.html) (cppreference.com)

### Raising exceptions

Streams can also be configured to `throw` **exceptions** when a specific error occurs using the `exceptions(iostate)` method.
